## Description

  Develop a weather dashboard application that runs in the browser, and provides the user with the weather outlook for the city of their choice. The application will retrieve weather data using the OpenWeather One Call API, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

* Include form inputs that allow the user to search for a city.

* When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and future weather conditions, and search history is added to persistent storage.

* When current weather conditions for the city are displayed, the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

* The UV index must diplay a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

* Future weather conditions for the city must include a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

* When a city listed in the search history is clicked, the user is presented with current and future weather conditions for that city.
